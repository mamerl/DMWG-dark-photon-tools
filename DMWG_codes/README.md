# DMWG Codes

## Overview

This directory contains tools, code snippets, and documentation related to the Dark Matter Working Group (DMWG) efforts for reinterpretation of LHC searches and dark matter studies.

## Purpose

The Dark Matter Working Group develops and maintains tools and standards for:

- Dark matter model implementations
- Reinterpretation frameworks
- Analysis code for collider searches
- Interface libraries between different tools
- Validation and benchmarking scripts

## Contents

This directory will include:

### Model Files
- Simplified model implementations
- UFO (Universal FeynRules Output) model files
- Model validation scripts

### Reinterpretation Tools
- Tools for reinterpreting LHC searches in terms of dark matter models
- Statistical analysis frameworks
- Limit setting procedures

### Interface Code
- Python/C++/Fortran interfaces
- Data format converters
- Integration with common HEP tools

### Benchmarks and Validation
- Reference calculations
- Cross-check scripts
- Comparison with published results

## Getting Started

*To be populated with setup instructions*

```bash
# Example setup commands
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# python setup.py install
```
