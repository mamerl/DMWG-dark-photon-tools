# MadDM

## Overview

MadDM (MADdm: MAd Dark Matter) is a tool for computing dark matter observables within particle physics models. It is based on MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and allows for the automatic calculation of:

- Relic density
- Direct detection cross-sections
- Indirect detection signals
- Collider signatures

## Purpose in this Repository

This directory contains instructions, configuration files, and examples for setting up and using MadDM for dark matter reinterpretation studies in the context of LHC searches.

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the official MadDM documentation:
- Official website: https://launchpad.net/maddm
- Documentation: https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph/wiki/MadDM
